    description:
      'Most people at Haiqu are focused on really small things like qubits, but Richard is focused on really big things like company vision, and elephants. He believes practical quantum computing will be essential to the design of clean technology which can put our planet and its elephants on a better path. He started Haiqu to make quantum computing practical as soon as possible.  Richard studied Engineering Physics at Stanford University and spent some time focusing on the intersection of low-earth-orbit satellite and mobility as an entrepreneur-in-residence at a corporate VC.',

He has a Ph.D. in theoretical condensed matter physics from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and did postdocs at the ETH Zurich, and jointly at the University of Chicago and University of Zurich, as a Marie Sklodowska-Curie (MSCA) Fellow. Maciej’s interests lie at the intersection of information theory, machine learning, and quantum field theory with the Alps.',

      'After co-founding an ed-tech startup and working in an energy-tech startup, Sam spent 3 years managing quantum startups within the Creative Destruction Lab’s Quantum Stream. He has worked with an obnoxiously large proportion of the quantum ecosystem and has seen many companies stumble, and a few succeed. He puts this expertise, alongside his unrelenting urge to talk to people, to good use as our Head of Growth. Sam has a Masters from the University of Toronto and does stand-up comedy part-time until he can quit his day job.',

With a background in diagrammatic calculi for quantum mechanics, he is deeply interested in the intersection of theoretical physics and quantum information. Can’t get a hold of him? He is probably out keeping exponents imaginary and shareholder value real.',

Yura comes from an AI background and is still trying to understand what all these researchers above are talking about. Yura's clear advantage is that he has watched more anime than anyone in quantum computing. Nani?!`,
